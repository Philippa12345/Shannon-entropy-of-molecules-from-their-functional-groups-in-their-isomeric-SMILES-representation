# Shannon-entropy-of-molecules-from-their-functional-groups-in-their-isomeric-SMILES-representation
This script identifies the different functional groups from the isomeric SMILES (from PubChem) of each metabolite in glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. Based on the functional group count, and the number of carbons in the molecule, the program then calculates the Shannon entropy of that molecule.
